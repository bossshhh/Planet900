# Planet900
A Floor796-style interactive pixel-art multiverse with mythological realms, procedural events, and layered lore.

Planet900
Theory:
The Ninefold Crown existed in countless iterations across time, each time it collapses a new one forms, 
This is the 900th cycle —> the 900th attempt at a stable cosmos.

Cycle 900 is different something changed at reboot something didn’t reset because its the first cycle with memory.. 

It consists of:
- 9 realms
- 9 epic events
- 9 anchor beings
- 900 total Floors
- 900 memory shards
- 900th iteration of existence

A large-scale interactive pixel-art multiverse inspired by the mechanics of Floor796.
Planet900 combines:

layered mythological realms

looping pixel animations

synchronized MP4 tile rendering

cross-myth epic events

a browser-based animation editor

a data-driven world engine

This repository hosts the source structure, design documents, lore bibles, engine blueprints, and (later) code + assets for the Planet900 project.

Project Goals

Build a massive explorable multiverse in pixel-art form

Use a Floor796-style animation pipeline (MP4 looping tiles with sync)

Create an internal browser-based pixel editor

Support hundreds of realms, floors, events, and characters

Mix mythologies (Norse, Greek, Egyptian, Celtic, Chinese, etc.)

Implement dynamic events and hidden interactions per floor
