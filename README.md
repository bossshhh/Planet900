# Planet900
A Floor796-style interactive pixel-art multiverse with mythological realms, procedural events, and layered lore.

Planet900

A large-scale interactive pixel-art multiverse inspired by the mechanics of Floor796.
Planet900 combines:

layered mythological realms

looping pixel animations

synchronized MP4 tile rendering

cross-myth epic events

a browser-based animation editor

a data-driven world engine

This repository hosts the source structure, design documents, lore bibles, engine blueprints, and (later) code + assets for the Planet900 project.

Project Goals

Build a massive explorable multiverse in pixel-art form

Use a Floor796-style animation pipeline (MP4 looping tiles with sync)

Create an internal browser-based pixel editor

Support hundreds of realms, floors, events, and characters

Mix mythologies (Norse, Greek, Egyptian, Celtic, Chinese, etc.)

Implement dynamic events and hidden interactions per floor
