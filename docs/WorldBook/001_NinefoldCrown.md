# 001 – The Ninefold Crown
The Ninefold Crown is the highest structural layer of Planet900: a ring-like
formation of nine mythic realms orbiting a central cosmic rupture known as the
Crown Rift. Every realm has its own physics, culture, cosmology, and narrative
identity, yet all are subtly connected through ancient pathways and shared
primordial origins.

The Ninefold Crown functions as both a cosmological map and a narrative
framework, defining how realms influence each other and how major events ripple
across existence.

## 1. Structure of the Crown

The nine realms are arranged around the Crown Rift, but they are not fixed in
space. Instead, they drift through a slow orbital pattern, sometimes drawing
closer together, sometimes pulling apart. This drifting determines:

- periods of increased cross-realm interaction  
- rare alignments called **Convergences**  
- weakened boundaries where events spill across realms  

Each realm is massive — continent-scale or larger — and shaped by a dominant
mythic force (ice, fire, light, death, nature, etc.). Together, they form the
Ninefold Crown.

**The nine realms are:**

1. Asgard – Realm of order, law, and divine governance  
2. Midgard – Mortal convergence zone  
3. Niflheim – Primordial ice and whispers of creation  
4. Muspelheim – Realm of destructive fire and raw force  
5. Vanaheim – Nature, cycles, balance  
6. Alfheim – Light, perception, and communication  
7. Svartalfheim – Forge, craft, and subterranean industry  
8. Jotunheim – Colossal beings and landscape-scale giants  
9. Helheim – Realm of death, memory, and stillness

These names are inspired by Norse cosmology but interpreted freely for Planet900.

## 2. The Crown Rift

At the center of the Ninefold Crown lies the **Crown Rift**, a swirling fracture
in reality that predates the realms themselves. It is neither alive nor dead,
neither void nor matter — it is a boundary of existence that touches all things
without being part of them.

The Rift is responsible for:

- rare portals that open unpredictably  
- strange echoes that influence events in all realms  
- anomalous creatures or fragments appearing in unexpected places  
- the possibility of **Primordial Events**  

No one fully understands the Rift, but every realm is affected by it.

## 3. Rules of the Crown

Though realms differ wildly, several fundamental rules govern the Ninefold
Crown:

### **Rule 1 — Shared Primordial Origin**
All realms contain traces of the same ancient formative forces.
Ice in Niflheim and fire in Muspelheim share a distant connection.
Death in Helheim and foresight in Asgard both touch the Crown Rift.

### **Rule 2 — Drift Determines Interaction**
Realms move. Their proximity controls:

- how strong cross-realm portals are  
- which events can overlap  
- which entities can travel  
- when epic events become possible  

A rare alignment of three or more realms is called a **Tri-Crown**, and usually
precedes major story arcs.

### **Rule 3 — Events Echo Across Realms**
A large event in one realm can create:

- distortions  
- omens  
- energy surges  
- entity migrations  

Every realm reacts differently depending on its nature.

### **Rule 4 — Floors Are the Local Structure**
Realms are divided into layered regions called **floors**.  
Floors contain:

- locations  
- entities  
- ambient loops  
- interactive hotspots  
- events  

Travel within a realm usually means moving floor to floor.

### **Rule 5 — Cross-Realm Travel Is Not Freely Available**
Portals, bridges, and mythic pathways exist, but are:

- rare  
- event-triggered  
- unstable  
- sometimes one-directional  

This preserves the uniqueness of each realm.

## 4. Cross-Realm Logic

Interactions between realms follow several predictable principles.

### **A. Proximity Logic**
When two realms drift close:

- portals strengthen  
- ambient distortions bleed across  
- events may join together  
- entities may cross over  

### **B. Mythic Resonance**
Realms with similar themes influence each other more:

- Fire and ice create violent interactions  
- Death realms respond to mortal realm events  
- Light realms detect disturbances before others  
- Crafting realms amplify weapon- or artifact-based events  

### **C. Epic Event Triggers**
An epic event may require:

- realm alignment  
- certain global states  
- previous events firing  
- actions taken by heroes or entities  

Epic events always affect multiple realms, sometimes permanently.

## 5. Narrative Purpose of the Crown

The Ninefold Crown establishes:

- the “scale” of Planet900  
- the long-term story arcs  
- the rules for how worlds collide  
- a consistent logic for crossovers  
- a structure that supports infinite expansion  

It is the cosmological skeleton of the entire project.

## 6. Current Known Anomalies

Though the Crown appears stable, several known anomalies exist:

- **Temporal Echoes:** repeated events across distant floors  
- **Existence Overlaps:** entities appearing in two realms at once  
- **Rift Whispers:** messages of unknown origin  
- **Unexplained Portals:** one-way doors leading to realms beyond the nine  

These anomalies hint that the Crown Rift has deeper layers not yet understood.

## 7. Path Forward

As Planet900 expands, each realm will gain:

- full floor maps  
- unique entities and mythic beings  
- small / medium / big / epic events  
- portal logic  
- visual identity and pixel-art design  
- long-term consequences shaped by epic events

The Ninefold Crown is the anchor from which all the rest grows.
