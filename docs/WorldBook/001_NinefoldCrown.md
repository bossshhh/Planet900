## 1. Top Layer – The Ninefold Crown

The Ninefold Crown is a floating configuration of nine massive "realm-islands".
They drift around the Crown Rift, a swirling manifestation of Ginnungagap.

Each realm:
- Has its own physics, tone, and mythic rules
- Can connect to others via branches, bridges, portals, or special events
- Influences the others through epic events and subtle echoes

The Crown Rift:
- Is the central void that touches all realms indirectly
- Can open rare portals allowing travel to any mythology
- Is strongly tied to primordial events (like The Primordial Wakes)
